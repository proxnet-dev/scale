# proxnet-scale
Scalable module management and data import system

## Getting Started
Extract the code to a directory with sufficient read and write permissions.<br>
Ensure you have [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.<br>
Run `npm i` to install the (one) dependency (chalk).<br>
Run `npm start win` for Windows systems, or `npm start unix` for unix-based systems (shell script)

## Developing Modules
Copy `example-module.mjs` to the `modules` folder, then rename it fittingly.
